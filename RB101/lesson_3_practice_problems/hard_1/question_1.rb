# What do you expect to happen when the greeting variable is referenced in the
# last line of the code below?

if false
  greeting = "hello world"
end

greeting

# Answer: The return value of the method is the variable greeting.

=begin
Result: partially correct - greeting is nil here, and no "undefined method or
local variable" exception is thrown. Typically, when you reference an
uninitialized variable, Ruby will raise an exception, stating that it’s
undefined. However, when you initialize a local variable within an if clause,
even if that if clause doesn’t get executed, the local variable is initialized
to nil.
